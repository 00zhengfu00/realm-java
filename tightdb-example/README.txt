Tightdb example instructions
============================

Below are instructions for testing the Tightdb example application in Java.


1. Prerequisites:
-----------------
1. Installation of Eclipse
   - Download and install Eclipse from www.eclipse.org

2. Installation of JDK6
   - Download and install JDK6 from oracle.com


2. Installation of tightdb example
----------------------------------
1. Download and extract tightdb example to a directory e.g. "./tightdb".

2. Create new workspace directory "./tightdb/workspace". 
   - Open eclipse and select above directory

3. Import Example:
   Select "File->Import". 
   Choose "Maven->Existing Maven Project". Root directory: Browse for "tightdb-example"

   Note: Errors may occur at this point about missing Maven plugins. 
   Those will be resolved after generating and installing additional plugins later on 
   (see 4. Generating tightdb classes)

4. Configure JDK on your project.
   - Ensure the JDK6 is selected in Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs. 
     Preferences is located in the "Eclipse" menu on Mac and in the "Window" menu on Windows and linux.
   - If it's not there, use the "Search" command on the same screen 
     and navigate to the folder where it was installed.
   - Make sure the project is configured to use the JDK6 by right-clicking "tightdb-example" 
     and select "Properties"; 
     - Select "Java Build Path" and ensure "JRE System Library [JavaSE-1.6]" is there
     - Select "Java Compiler" and select "Use complience from execution environment 'JavaSE-1.6'


3. Running the application
--------------------------

1. Run the application
   - Select "Run -> Run"

and output from the application will be shown in the Console window.
 

4. Generating tightdb classes
-----------------------------
You can now change the example and as you wish. If you change or add Tightdb Tables, 
you need to regenerate the typesafe classes that Tightdb provides based on the Table specifications.


1. Save files
   - Save all edited source files containing @Table definitions

2. Right-click tightdb-example -> Run As -> Maven generate-sources.
   This will generate custom classes for your tables in "com.tightdb.generated".
   The first time this is done, Eclipse will installadditional plugins if not already present.

3. Refresh the project (F5) and the generated classes are available with full autocompletion etc.

You can now run your application again.



FAQ:
====
Q1: I get the following error when generating classes as describe in step 4) above:
"[ERROR] JVM is not suitable for processing annotation! ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler() is null."
A1: Configure JDK6 as described in 2.4.
