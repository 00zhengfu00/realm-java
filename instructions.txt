1. Compile jni_1.0 in VS2010 for the desired architecture (e.g. x32 or x64).

2. Copy the compiled TightDB DLL into the "tightdb_java2" folder, the DLL must be named "tightdb.dll".

3. Create workspace for Eclipse (alternatively, you can skip this step and use some existing workspace).
   a) Create "workspace" directory (outside the "tightdb_java2" folder)
   b) Open Eclipse
   c) Point workspace to the newly created directory "workspace"

4. Import "tightdb_java2".
   a) In Eclipse click on File -> Import
   b) Select "Existing Maven projects" as an import source
   c) Select the "tightdb_java2" folder as root directory
   d) You should see 1 item in the projects list (e.g. /pom.xml - tightdb_java2...), make sure it is checked

5. Make sure the JDK6 (or JDK7) is installed and configured.
   a) Make sure you have JDK6 installed
   b) Make sure JDK6 is displayed on the list in Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs.
      If it's not there, use the "Search" command on the same screen and navigate Eclipse to the folder where it was installed in
   c) Make sure the project is configured to use the JDK6 by right-clicking it -> Properties -> (both Java Compiler and Java Build Path)

6. Execute the tests and examples.
   a) Execute the simple PoC "TableTest" (in the "com.tightdb" package) by right-clicking it -> Run As -> Java Application
   b) Execute the example "WorkingExample" (in the "com.tightdb.example" package) by right-clicking it -> Run As -> Java Application
   c) You can start playing with "WorkingExample", new code will be automatically generated by changing the annotated classes
