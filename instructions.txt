1. Compile jni_1.0 in VS2010 for the desired architecture (e.g. x32 or x64).

2. Copy the compiled TightDB DLL into the "tightdb_java2" folder, the DLL must be named "tightdb.dll".

3. Create workspace for Eclipse (alternatively, you can skip this step and use some existing workspace).
   a) Create "workspace" directory (outside the "tightdb_java2" folder)
   b) Open Eclipse
   c) Point workspace to the newly created directory "workspace"

4. Import "tightdb_java2".
   a) In Eclipse click on File -> Import
   b) Select "Existing Maven projects" as an import source
   c) Select the "tightdb_java2" folder as root directory
   d) You should see 1 item in the projects list (e.g. /pom.xml - tightdb_java2...), make sure it is checked

5. Execute the tests and examples.
   a) Execute the simple PoC "TableTest" (in the "com.tightdb" package) by right-clicking it -> Run As -> Java Application
   b) Execute the example "WorkingExample" (in the "com.tightdb.example" package) by right-clicking it -> Run As -> Java Application
   c) You can start playing with "WorkingExample", new code will be automatically generated by changing the annotated classes
