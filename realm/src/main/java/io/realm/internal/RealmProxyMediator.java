/**
 * Interface for the RealmProxyMediator class. This interface contain all static methods introduced by the
 * annotation processor as part of the RealmProxy classes.
 *
 * Classes implementing this interface act as binders between the static methods inside each RealmProxy and the code
 * at runtime. We cannot rely on using reflection as the RealmProxies are generated by the annotation processor
 * before ProGuard is run. So after ProGuard has run there is a mismatch between the name of the RealmProxy and
 * the original RealmObject class.
 *
 * As a consequence RealmProxyMediators also only know about the classes that was compiled at the same time. To allow
 * library classes and app classes to work together you should use a {@link io.realm.internal.modules.RealmClassCollection}.
 *
 * The annotation processor always generate a class called RealmMediatorProxyImpl if not told otherwise. This will
 * cause conflicts when using libraries and appcode together if both use Realm, so library projects <bold>must</bold>
 * use custom modules that will disable the generation of this class.
 *
 * @see TODO Reference to builder pattern where custom modules are set
 * @see TODO Reference to annotation marking it as library module
